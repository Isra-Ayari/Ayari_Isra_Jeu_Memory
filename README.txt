Project: Match The Cat

Description: "Match The Cat" is a memory card game where players have to match cards that contain the same image before the time runs out and in the fewest possible number of moves.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Json

Main features: Landing page, score, timer, local high score

New features explored: 
*fetching data using Json
*Storing data locally using 'localStorage'
*Modifying/setting CSS attributes using JS

Difficulties encountered & Solutions provided:
1) How to mark flipped cards as such?
	|-> performed research on using classList to add a 'flipped' value to the cards
2) How to store local highscore?
	|-> read articles on the use of localStorage to store data that lasts beyond the active session
3) How to switch between divs dynamically instead of creating multiple HTML pages?
	|-> consulted articles on Stack Overflow
